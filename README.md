* **WNS_solution_1.ipynb**: This notebook contains the solution that I submitted for the competition, it contains EDA, some preprocessing steps, and some model architecture approaches.

* **WNS_final_submission**: This notebook contains a post- competition solution where I mainly focused on building some strong feature engineering and used LGBM for the ML algorithm.

# Notes
- Although in my submission notebook my AUC for the validation score was ~80% in the comeptition private leaderboard it dropped down to ~72%. So The goal with the post-comeptition notebook was to make the data more robust and although the AUC is not as high as in the first notebook, this time around ~75%, Based on some of the kernels that where shared by some of the competition participants, this final solution may have boost a little bit more my final private score.

- For the record the top AUC score in the competition was 0.7544505715

# Leaderboard
- **Private Leaderboard score**: 0.7114547011
